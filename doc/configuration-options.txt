 201-05-14



 Overview

 This file lists all available configuration options for libfizmo. Please
 note that other options may be available depending on the interface which
 libfizmo is linked to. The following list shows all the options that the API
 understands via the "set_configuration_value" function, whether they're
 actually read from a config file or otherwise accessible is up to the
 interface.



 Variables

 Option values may contain variables. Variables start with a dollar sign $
 and are enclosed by parantheses. Example: $(VARIABLE_NAME). The only currently
 implemented variable is $(HOME), which refers to the current user's home
 directory.




 List of valid libfizmo option names and values

 locale = <locale-name>
 Defines which language settings libfizmo should use by default. The standard
 setting is "en_US".

 i18n-search-path = <path-value>
 Takes a colon-separated list of directories. The default installation will set
 this to "$(INSTALL_DIR)/share/fizmo/locales".

 z-code-path = <path-value>
 [...]

 z-code-root-path = <path-value>
 [...]

 savegame-path = <directory-name>
 Gives the directory name where savegames are read from and written to. Should
 be specified as an absolute directory file name.

 transscript-filename = <filename>
 Specifies the default filename for the transcript file. Especially useful
 when "start-script-when-story-starts" is enabled, so that transcripting
 may always start directly without asking for a filename.

 save-text-history-paragraphs = <number-of-paragraphs>
 [...]

 start-script-when-story-starts
 When selected, stream 2 will be enabled directly from the story start. This
 allows a user to capture a full transscript of the story, including the
 introductional text.

 sync-transcript
 When enabled, this option will try to flush and fsync output to the
 trankscript file as soon as possible.

 start-command-recording-when-story-starts
 [...]

 command-filename = <filename>
 [...]

 start-file-input-when-story-starts
 [...]

 random-mode = <random | predictable>
 By default, the random-mode is always set to "random", meaning that the
 randomizaion generator will try to deliver random numbers. When set to
 "predictable", the generator will always deliver the same range of
 numbers, as defined in the Z-Specification[1] section 2.4.2.

 foreground-color = <color-name>
 This sets a custom foreground color. The color name must be one out of
 black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white.

 background-color = <color-name>
 This sets a custom background color. The color name must be one out of
 black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white.

 quetzal appendix in the Z-Specification[1], section 3.

 [...]

 disable-sound
 Force libfizmo to not play any sound.
