    <p>libfizmo aims to provide a Z-Machine interpreter core library in plain C. The goal is to have an interpreter library with as little dependencies as possible to allow for easy portability. In order to use it stand-alone, you have to invoke the “fizmo_start” function in “src/interpreter/fizmo.c” with a screen interface. Check fizmo-console for an example.</p>

    <p>Currently the interpreter is in beta status, which means it seems to run all non-version-6 games quite well without any known bugs.</p>

    <p>Dependencies:
      <ul>
        <li>libxml2 for parsing of .ifiction files (optional)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Please send bug reports (or other requests) to fizmo@spellbreaker.org.</p>

    <p>libfizmo was written by Christoph Ender in 2005-2014.</p>

    <p>For the latest version, see <a href="http://spellbreaker.org/~chrender/fizmo/"/>.</p>

    <p>libfizmo uses the Mersenne twister from <a href="http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/MT2002/emt19937ar.html"/> as a random number generator implementation:<br/>“A C-program for MT19937, with initialization improved 2002/1/26.<br/>Coded by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto.<br/>Copyright (C) 1997 – 2002, Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura,<br/>All rights reserved.”<br/>For full copyright notice see “src/fizmo/mt19937ar.c”.</p>

    <p>libfizmo includes hyphenation patterns provided by the hyph-utf8 project at <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/language/hyph-utf8/"/>. For every file's detailed respective copyright information, please refer to the description stored at the top of the corresponding file:

    <p>Currently fizmo is in beta status, meaning it might do unexpected things such as stop with an error message, crash or cleesh your machine into a frog. There is no warranty of any kind whatsoever and you're entirely on your own when running it.</p>
